## Welcome to my first Express Project and my first time using NODE!

It displays parts of my San Diego Top Spots project in Node.  It also lets you navigate to the data.json folder if you wanted to see the raw data used for the Project

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.
